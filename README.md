# UNIT9 Development Intern Test

## Introduction

Dear Candidate,

We're extremely excited that you're interested in joining us for programming internship. We know you've only recently started your adventure with development, although we do require basic programming knowledge. This is a simple test that will verify some of these essential skills.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository as a private repository of your own.

1. Clone your private fork.

1. Make sure you have node.js installed.

1. Run `npm install`

1. You are provided with a small aplication that automatically tests your solutions. You can run it as many times as you want and it will not impact your score. You can use this to understand whether your solution is performing as expected. Please mind that this correctness is only one out of three evaluated aspects. We also evaluate the algorithm you wrote (the code, naming conventions, structure etc.) as well as performance.  Please look into `tasks` folder. It contains a pair of a .js file and .md file for each task.
The .js file is where you write your implementation. This is the only file you need to edit. The .md file contains the description of the task.  So start by reading `tasks/task1.md`, understand what the goal is and then edit `tasks/task1.js` with your implementation. Then do this for as many remaining tasks as you can.

1. Next, test your solutions by running the following command:
`node .`

1. Once done, push your changes to your **private** repository and give access to your UNIT9 point of contact.

That's it! Have fun!
